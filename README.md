# Training
1. Constructor code(EMpp.java):- demonstrate initializing variables using constructor and displaying the details of employee

2. overloading code(Overloading1.java):- Emp methodOverloading class is to demonstrate method overloading concept using inheritance

3. overriding code(Overriding.java):- Emp methodOverloading class is to demonstrate method overriding concept using inheritance

4. continueStatement code(Main.java):- The continue statement is used in loop control structure when you need to jump to the next iteration of the loop immediately. It can be used with for loop or while loop and to demonstrate it I used for loop.

5. if else(Training2.java):-Emp controlStatements class is to demonstrate if-else decision making statements.

6. switch code(Er.java):-Emp switchStatement class is to demonstrate switch condition statement.

7. Substring code(Substring.java):- Substring class is to demonstrate extracting substring from a string.

8. reverse string code(Stringr.java):-Reversestring class is to demonstrate reversing a string using single for loop and charAt() to string method.

9. Immutable code(Immutable1.java):- Immutableclass is to demonstarte immutable class as well as immutable members of that class using final and private  c    keywords.We can not modify the member of immutable class after creation of object.

10. regex code(Regex1.java):-  Regularexpression class is to validate the employee details like email, employee id, phone number and address. The following restrictions are imposed in the email address local part a> It allows numeric values from 0 to 9.

11. Throw code(ExpThrow.java):-The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.If the age is less than 18, we are throwing the    ArithmeticException otherwise print a message Eligible to vote.

12. Exception code (Arrayexception.java):-

    a]- using try catch - Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. It must be used   within the method.If an exception occurs at the particular statement in the try block, the rest of the block code will not execute. 

    b]- using try catch ladder- so using this we can work with more exception as in this code I worked withIndexOutOfBoundsException and Arithmetic Expressions in a single code         
                                       
13. Exception code with fianlly (Exceptiontest.java):- I took 5 statements and put some condition and if satisfies that condition then it prints all statements otherwise it prints only those statements before those conditin was not applied.Also use finally ,"finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.  

14. Collection(Linked.java):- The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.The program shows implementation of a doubly-linked list with the addition of new nodes at the end of the list. 
 
15. Collection2(Lsit.java):- 

    1) used add function - Appends the specified element to the end of this list,so make two linkedlist named node and node1 and add integers in them.

    2) used addAll function- Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list, starting at the specified position,so linked node and node1 and output came as linked output of both nodes.        
                         
    3) used remove function- Retrieves and removes the head (first element) of this list,so function was used as remove(2), so integer at index 2 got  removed. 
    
    4) used removeAll function- etrieves and removes all elements of list,so used this function and removed all the integers in both the nodes.
             
             
16. Set(Set.java):-  This code contains the functionality of hash set and linkhashset.

     Hash set- unordered, no duplicates,one null
                
     LinkedHash set- ordered, no duplicates, one null
                
                
       
17. TreeSet(Set1.java):- This code contains the functionality of Sorted set.

    Sortedset- uses extense to Treeset,ordered,no null,no duplicates
                     
                     
Map:- It is combination of key and value,here every key and value is an object.
      In map duplicate keys are not allowed and duplicate values are allowed.
      
     18.  HashMap(Entry1.java):- HashMap is the implementation of Map, but it doesn't maintain any order and I implemented it taking key and value as integer                                and string.

      19. LinkedHashMap(Entry2.java):- LinkedHashMap is the implementation of Map. It inherits HashMap class. It maintains insertion order.

      20. TreeMap(Entry.java):- TreeMap is the implementation of Map and SortedMap. It maintains ascending order and implemented it by taking 3 random                                     variables and got the sorted output in ascending order.
      
      
21. Employee Hash Map With Duplicate class(EmployeeHashMapWithDuplicate.java) explains that values can be duplicate in java and this concept was explained in desired code with data of employee id and employee name because every key and every object in map interface is an object


22. Employee Hash Map Without Duplicate class(Withoutduplicates.java) explains that keys cannot be duplicated in java in this also data is in format of emp id and name. Created a class with  key and value and used this class as  composite key and later defined an equals and hashcode function as well.

23. MultiThreading(Session.java):- Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously and created a constructor and thread it as custom thread and main thread and seen output got output for the same.

    1)start():- It is used to start the execution of the thread and I used this function by starting two different loops for both the threads of int i <=10 and got output parallely for the same.
                               
    2)setName():- It changes the name of the thread so i set the name as sum and got the output of custom thread as sum.
                               
    3)join():- It waits for a thread to die and by using this function earlier the number output from 1-10 was getting parallely,now it is coming as 1-10 for a single and when that thread ends then 1-10 for another thread.
    
24. Count Incrementand and Decrement using Thread(IncDecUsingThread.java)  :-Demonstrate the way of execution of two threads using a count varaible and using  decrement and increment function inside try catch .

25.newCachedThreadPool(Task.java):- creates a new thread pool that creates the new threads when needed but will still use the previously created thread whenever they are available to use and executed for loop for i<=10 but it executed all in 5 threads only.

26.newFixedThreadPool(Task1.java):- The method creates a thread pool of the fixed size like I fixed int i <10 so, it created thread pool of same size.

27.newSingleThreadExecutor(Task2.java):- The method creates a new thread.

28.Demosem_class(Demosem.java):- Simple thread execution using for loop from int i 0-1000 and call increment is used .

29.Demosync_class(Demosync.java):- Two threads are there in a class and for the threads for loop is implemented from 0-1000 and it was seen that there was data inconsistency.

30.Demosync1_class(Demosync1.java):-Two threads are there in a class and for the threads for loop is implemented from 0-1000 same as above but now we used syncronized function int increment so in output datainconsistency is not seen.

31.Sync_class(Sync.java):- Synchronized block is used in this code to lock an object for any shared resource and more efficent than synchronized method.
