# Training
Constructor code(EMpp.java):- demonstrate initializing variables using constructor and displaying the details of employee;

overloading code(Overloading1.java):- Emp methodOverloading class is to demonstrate method overloading concept using inheritance;

continueStatement code(Main.java):- class is to demonstrate continue statement using for each loop.;

if else(training2.java):-Emp controlStatements class is to demonstrate if-else decision making statements.;

switch code(er.java):-Emp switchStatement class is to demonstrate switch condition statement.;

Substring code(Substring.java):- Substring class is to demonstrate extracting substring from a string;

reverse string code(stringr.java):-Reversestring class is to demonstrate reversing a string using single for loop and charAto string method.;

Immutable code(Immutable1.java):- Immutableclass is to demonstarte immutable class as well as immutable members of that class using final and private keywords.We can not modify the member of immutable class after creation of object.;

regex code(Regex1.java):-  Regularexpression class is to validate the employee details like email, employee id, phone number and address. The following restrictions are imposed in the email address local part a> It allows numeric values from 0 to 9.

Throw code(ExpThrow.java):-The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.If the age is less than 18, we are throwing the ArithmeticException otherwise print a message Eligible to vote.

Exception code (arrayexception.java):- a]- using try catch - Java try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. It must be used   within the method.If an exception occurs at the particular statement in the try block, the rest of the block code will not execute. 

                                       b]- using try catch twice- so using this we can work with more exception as in this code I worked withIndexOutOfBoundsException and Arithmetic Expressions in a single code         
                                       
Exception code with fianlly (Exceptiontest.java):- I took 5 statements and put some condition and if satisfies that condition then it prints all statements otherwise it prints only those statements before those conditin was not applied.Also use finally ,"finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.  

Collection(linked.java):- The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.The program shows implementation of a doubly-linked list with the addition of new nodes at the end of the list. 
 
Collection2(lsit.java):- 1]used add function - Appends the specified element to the end of this list,so make two linkedlist named node and node1 and add integers in them.


                         2]used addAll function- Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list, starting at the specified position,so linked node and node1 and output came as linked output of both nodes.
                         
                         
                         
                         3]used remove function- Retrieves and removes the head (first element) of this list,so function was used as remove(2), so integer at index 2 got removed.
                         
                         
                         
                         4]used removeAll function- etrieves and removes all elements of list,so used this function and removed all the integers in both the nodes.
             
             
Set(set.java):-  This code contains the functionality of hash set and linkhashset.

                Hash set- unordered, no duplicates,one null
                
                LinkedHash set- ordered, no duplicates, one null
                
                
       
TreeSet(set1.java):- This code contains the functionality of Sorted set.

                     Sortedset- uses extense to Treeset,ordered,no null,no duplicates
                     
                     
Map:- It is combination of key and value,here every key and value is an object.
      In map duplicate keys are not allowed and duplicate values are allowed.
      
      HashMap(entry1.java):- HashMap is the implementation of Map, but it doesn't maintain any order and I implemented it taking key and value as integer                                and string.

      LinkedHashMap(entry2.java):-  	LinkedHashMap is the implementation of Map. It inherits HashMap class. It maintains insertion order.

      TreeMap(entry.java):- TreeMap is the implementation of Map and SortedMap. It maintains ascending order and implemented it by taking 3 random                                     variables and got the sorted output in ascending order.
